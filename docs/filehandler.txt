File Handler Documentation:

The FileHandler should read text files into from a director "data" in the root of the project.
FileHandler uses java.nio to correctly path to a directory beside the the project directory, it
must be named "data". It catches file access exceptions with specific outputs for debugging as well
as broader exceptions, throwing no errors itself.


FileHandler
-------------------
getFilenames();
getFilenames(int num);
getContents(String filename);
-------------------


filehandler method description:

// returns a string arraylist of file names
Arraylist<String> getFilenames();

// returns the string name of a file given by its index
getFilenames(int num);

// returns the contents of a file as a string given its name
String getContents(String filename);

Potential Improvements:
getFilenames is partially redundant. Portions could be made more efficient
