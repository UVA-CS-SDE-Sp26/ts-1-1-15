The cipher class should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.

Cipher Pseudocode:

create class level variable that can access ciphers folder in my proj
Open file "ciphers.key.txt"

if file cannot be opened, print error
    then stop

read first line into array called PLAIN
read second line into array called CIPHER

input ciphered string

set decoded string to empty

for each character ch in CIPHER
    if ch exists in CIPHER
        find index i of ch in CIPHER
        append PLAIN[i] to decoded string
    else
        append ch to decoded string
    end if
end for

output decoded string
