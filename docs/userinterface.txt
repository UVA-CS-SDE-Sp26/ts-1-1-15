This class controls the command line interface for the user. When the program runs with no arguments a list
of available files should be printed to the screen. When the program runs with just a number as an argument
the contents of the corresponding file should be displayed on the screen. When no second parameter is
given the program uses the default key. If a second parameter is specified this indicates which cipher to
use to decode the file.
